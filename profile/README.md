## üß¨ About ProteinGym

ProteinGym is a comprehensive benchmarking platform for protein fitness prediction and design. Our mission is to enable rigorous and fair comparisons of computational methods that predict the effects of mutations on protein function.

## üìä What We Provide

- **Large-Scale Benchmarks**: Extensive Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays covering millions of protein variants
- **Standardized Evaluation**: Fair comparison frameworks for mutation effect predictors
- **Open Resources**: Publicly available datasets, scores, and evaluation tools
- **Community Hub**: A platform for researchers to share and compare their models

## üî¨ Key Features

### Substitution Benchmark
- ~2.7M missense variants across 217 DMS assays
- 2,525 clinical proteins with variant annotations
- Comprehensive coverage of protein families and functions

### Indel Benchmark
- ~300K indel mutants across 74 DMS assays
- 1,555 clinical proteins
- Support for insertion and deletion mutations
